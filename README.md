Espresso Captive Portal Spring version


JEspresso is an modern and customizable Espresso fork, written in Java/Typescript. Useful for setup custom hotspots without pay external cloud services. Works with Ubiquiti Unifi controller 4.X and 5.X (it doesn't support Dream Machine yet) and you can install it on small systems like Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (recommended 4)

It does not require any external web server and it can runs as a standalone application.
