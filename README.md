Espresso Captive Portal Spring version


JEspresso is an modern and customizable Espresso fork, written in Java/Typescript. Useful for setup custom hotspots without pay external cloud services. Works with Ubiquiti Unifi controller 4.X and 5.X (it doesn't support Dream Machine yet) and you can install it on small systems like Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (recommended 4)

It does not require any external web server and it can runs as a standalone application.

#### WARNING: Some countries' laws, require a logging data for guests activities from wifi hotspots. This tool does not collect any data or logs, so use it at your risk. If required in your country, install a logging system by yourself. I'm not responsible for law violations!
